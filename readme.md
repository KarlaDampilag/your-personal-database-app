# Project title

Your Personal Database

# Motivation

I wasted days trying to decide which specific CRUD web app to create - recipes, to do lists, quotes, etc. That's when I decided to just let the user design his/her own objects (or tables) with custom attributes (or table columns).

#Tech/framework used

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- PHP
- MySQL

# Features

This app allows the user to design his/her own objects (or tables) with custom attributes (or table columns). It could be anything the user has in mind - a person, an event, a book, a pokemon - anything.

Users must first create an account to perform any of the CRUD actions, but anyone can view public databases (owners can mark each of their databases as either public or private) and its contents.

So far, the app allows logged in users to create unlimited number of object (or tables) designs.

The user can then add, edit, and delete contents (or rows) under each of his objects (or tables) and unlimited number of contents under each object.
